$ npm install
$ npm start

Fine-tuning command lines
------------------------

Check python version:
        python3 --version
        
Check pip version:
        pip -- version

Install pip:
        python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
        
Install the OpenAI CLI: 
        pip install --upgrade openai

Add our API key:
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
        for example":
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="sdk-3344fnjsfknfwGDFR-34dhG"


To navigate to the folder holding the data, we use the cd (change directory) command:
        cd Documents/apps/we-wingit
        
Start the data preparation and use the -f flag to identify the file where our data is stored:
        openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f <LOCAL_FILE>
        for example:
        openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f we-wingit-data.csv
        
Install pandad:
         $ pip install openai pandas

To create a fine-tuned model
        openai api fine_tunes.create -t <TRAIN_FILE_ID_OR_PATH> -m <BASE_MODEL>
        for example:
        openai api fine_tunes.create -t we-wingit-data_prepared.jsonl -m davinci
        
To reconnect the stream (to check how the fine-tune is progressing or see if it has completed)
        openai api fine_tunes.follow -i <YOUR_FINE_TUNE_JOB_ID>
        for example:
        openai api fine_tunes.follow -i ft-bfubdoni4737dbsj
